# Tally Partners Scraper ðŸš€

Scrapes **all official Tally partners** via Tallyâ€™s partner API and exports them to CSV.

**Why this repo?**
- Uses Tallyâ€™s backend API (fast & reliable) â€” no brittle Selenium scraping.
- Progressive saving: writes to CSV in batches so you won't lose data if the run stops.
- Easy resume: if `tally_partners_complete.csv` exists, the scraper will skip duplicates.
